I can not find the three videos on this page,"Professor, Sorry, accordong to the message you sent to us, there should be three videos about Unix and Python. Unfortunately, I can not find them on this wedsite~ So could you please tell me where exactly the videos are? Best wishes",https://edstem.org/courses/1189/lessons/  here it is 
Peer study group,"Is anyone interested in forming a peer study group to meet on weekends (Saturday or Sunday) or weeknights (Tuesday or Friday) at UNSW/CBD? If you are interested, can you please comment below with your preferred time and location?",good idea~ let‘s form a group. 
Lecture_1 practice_Dict,I was trying to practise the turning machine example you taught in the lecture and I am struck with dictionary order when I run the for iteration in the instructions dictionary. I have attached the screen shots for your reference.The sequence of the keys in the output has changed surprisingly.,"Hi Phanindra, a dictionary is an unordered structure; we can iterate over all keys, but they are then enumerated in an order which is arbitrary, it can be different from machine to machine, and from run to run on a given machine."
Inaccuracy of standard deviation,"I am doing Lab_1 and find out that the standard deviation calculated manually is not consistent with the one calculated by standard module statistics. here is my code snippet
size = len(L)
L.sort()
mean = sum(L) / size
median = (L[size // 2] + L[size // 2 - 1]) / 2 if size % 2 == 0 else L[size // 2]
standard_deviation = sqrt(sum([(e-mean) ** 2 for e in L]) / size)
is inaccuracy caused by accumulated inaccuracy of float numbers calculation or I messed something up? Thanks

","Hi Tianle, I guess you are importing and using stdev rather than pstdev from the statistics module, hence estimate the the standard deviation from a sample rather than computing it from the population."
Doubt regarding enumerate(),"I had this doubt. I was looking at the functions in the Jupyter sheets where I came across this. Question : How is the output generated? For instance in the first command, the enumeration is being done in sorted/random manner? My thinking was that it would be sorting the set and then assigning integar values to get => [(0,10),(1,15),(2,25),(3,40)]. Is it being done randomly? If not what is happening behind the scene?

I tried with other command. Here too I am confused whats happening:",">>> type({100,200,300,400})

<class 'set'>

The type of {100,200,300,400} is 'set'. 'set' is unordered, so you cannot access the values using index unlike 'list' or 'tuple'.

More details: https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=set#set-types-set-frozenset"
Question about Drawing an Hexagram,"Dear Prof,

I'm wondering if there is some way to set the line colour to invisible, or set the line width = 0 so that I can just overwrite the filling other than the frame. Every time I draw a new triangle with line colour set to ('') and filling colour set to ('white') the prev just seem to kind of colour fading. I tried to read the python 3.6 turtle graphics documentation but I couldn't find my answers. So I post for help.

This question comes from my trying another way to draw an hexagram. That is, 
1) To draw a triangle with red line, white filling; adjust its direction;
2) To draw a new triangle with blue line, white filling; now I get this:3) To draw a new triangle in the same position as the first one, but with no line colour, and still white filling; now I get this:
Seems like I've got the right shape, but the line colour is lighter. To make it look better, I continuously draw the fourth triangle to overwrite the blue one. Finally I get this: 
In brief, how should I do to overwrite the filling to 'cut' the overlap lines but do nothing with the previous lines? I guess there may be some way like to set lines invisible or transparent...","Hi Tianpeng, I am sure you read the document at least as well as I did... The way I do it is draw one third of the line, then pen up and move by one third, then pen down and draw the remaining one third."
"
Lab","Silly question, are we to attend the lab tonight and complete the lab work with Matthew Perry,  6:30 to 8:30pm? Or is the session purely for people with queries only?


Promie ","Lab work is not assessed (there are no marks for it), these ""lab sessions"" are consultation for you to attend only if you have questions, if you need support."
Unix terminal issue,"As you have shown in the lecture, there are some commands operating on the terminal on your mac. however, the operating system I use on my laptop is windows 7 rather than Unix. So many commands you show on your mac are not recognized on my terminal. I wonder that are there equivalent commands for windows? Is it necessary for me to install a Unix operating system or use the virtual machine in order to catch you up on this terminal commands part? Am I going to get into further trouble if I keep running python on my windows system in this course?","Hi Xiaohan, there are indeed Windows equivalent to most Unix commands.

https://www.lemoda.net/windows/windows2unix/windows2unix.html
As the School machines are running Linux, and as I have a Mac, I can indeed only show you the Unix commands. It is not necessary for you to install a virtual machine on your windows machine, you can do so if you wish so, but it is not necessary for this course, you can score 100 in this course knowing nothing about the command line and Unix. I show you a few things which:

- can be used on a School machine

- provide some insights on working from the terminal (whatever the operating system happens to be).

You can ignore it, or practice it on a School machine, or see what the Windows equivalents are, or install Linux on your Windows machine; just go for the option that suits you."
Terminal software installation problems,"I followed the steps of the video software intallation Jupyter you posted. However, it didn't show the same results as it should be. Rather than the screenshot below, I don't know where is wrong and how to fix it up.","Hi Yufan, it is impossible for me to answer your question just based on this information, as all kinds of things could go wrong. I suggest you go to consultation tonight and ask the tutor to help out with this."
related to Workspaces,"I can not get access to the Jupyter notebook sheets on Workspaces. 

can you give me a permission to open it?  thank you . 

","Hi Jingchang, if you click on the Fork button, doesn't that create your own copy that you can work with?"
fstring doesn't work on drum,"python 3.5 doesn't have the f string feature and we don't have enough privilege to update new version of python on lab machine.

I can surely do the lab at home using my computer but it actually feels better going to the lab :D","I wrote somewhere, but I should have made it clearer, that on the School machines, you can run python3.6 by executing python3.6"
Lab_Q4 on standard deviation answer,,
How much maths knowledge is expected?,"Just wondering what the expected level of mathematics knowledge is, for when the closed book exams roll along. Using the current lab as an example, is calculating standard deviation manually (rather than having knowledge of and using the built-in maths/statistics modules) similar to anything we might encounter in the exams?","Hi Scott, I am not expecting you to remember any maths in the exam. The lectures and the labs sometimes have mathematical material, but it is usually treated as more advanced and optional. Commonsense is essentially all you need to do well in this course."
Lab1_task6 distance to the polygon edges,"I noticed you described ""distance from centre to edges of the octagon"" was 100, however when I drew it, I found unless I set the distance from centre to the vertices of the octagon as 100, the shape would not quite fit with your example. 

I measured your sample figure; ratio of (distance from the top of triangle to the centre) / (distance from edge to the centre) is close to 1.95, which is in fact 180 / 100 / cos(pi / 8), but rather, (distance from the top of triangle to the centre) / (distance from octagon vertices to the centre) is close to 180 / 100. That means you might have set""distance from centre to vertices of the octagon"" as 100, not distance to edges.","Hi Feng, indeed, I wanted to say, I should have said, ""distance to a vertex of the inscribed octagon"". Thanks for pointing this out.

Lab exercise,Will lab exercise be uploaded anywhere? so that students who not attending the lab can have a look and do those exercise in their own time?,"Solutions are posted one week later, in Resources, and also under Challenges for the flagged ones."
Slack Group For Discussion,,
Jupyter Notes for Lecture 2,"Please if you also upload the Jupyter notes for today's lecture as you had uploaded for lecture 1.

You have uploaded the text file and not the Jupyter file.","Hi Himanshu, I have done it already, under Resources, and checking again, it seems to be the right file."
Submitting the Quiz,Has the way to submit the quiz been published? Or do we just complete it in Ed under assignments?,"You can edit the file directly in Ed, or you can download the file, edit it locally, and then upload it. Eventually you have to click the Submit button. You can submit it as many times as you like. The last submitted version will be assessed."
Quiz performance,"Quiz will be tested for performance? like with some really big numbers or it will be just the numbers we have in the pdf?

By performance i mean memory, runtime and algorithm?","No no no, the PDF and associated tests in Ed show just examples of outputs, it just illustrates what the exercise is about, but I will use other test cases, and testing has to be taken seriously (will talk
more about it on Monday). For this quiz, performance should not be an issue, the list won't be large."
query regarding quiz,"I am relatively new to programming environment,  is the quiz only to do testing on the output of the code or do we have to make any changes in the code. If I am wrong I request you to highlight what is required to do.",if you need more detail re-watch lecture video (2:21:45) on moddle where Eric explains the requirement(how the list should be generated).
About special case in Quiz 1,"If the current algorithm can handle the situation that there is only one element in the list, can we still call this situation a special case? In my opinion, classified discussion will be needed when the current method cannot handle some case. Am I correct?

Or we defined the 1-element situation a special case just because of the consideration about time complexity?","Hi Jianyu, if you prefer, we can talk about ""simplest cases"". An empty list is the simplest case. Then a list of length 1 is the next simplest case... We should include what we consider to be all ""simplest cases"" in our test cases."
How many line of code?,"Whoever finished the quiz1, would you mind sharing how many lines of code you wrote to complete M and N. Just to get a hint on improvement, I'm very sure mine can be reworked to someting smaller. 

Mine:

M = 11 Line

N = 14 Line","For this short coding competition, I just implemented 2 line code to create M, but I don't think that shorter implementation is always better because it doesn't guarantee performance or readability. 

We should be careful not to be blinded by tangible figures."
"Lab 2, Question 3","Hi there, I'm having trouble understanding what this question means.

It seems like it's asking to find all possible arrangements of numbers 1 - 9, in the pattern described, such that the multiplication is true and also the addition of the columns are all equal.

However the given examples do not hold true when arranged in this way. I also don't understand what the 4th and fifth rows of asterisks are meant to represent (possibly space for larger numbers, up to seven digits? and then a row representing the addition of the columns?) I'm obviously misunderstanding, is there some other way it can be explained?

","The two solutions show the multiplicand, the multiplier and the result of the multiplication (first, second and last line) but not the intermediate results (third and fourth lines)."
Shall I post lab code?,"I just find that the due date of chanllenge iscoming.

I am not sure if it is necessary to post the code.

Does or it is okay if we just practised it ourselves?","Hi Keqiao, as mentioned in course outline and during lectures, labs are just for you to practice, they are not assessed."
Please never share your code in any forum discussion,,"code can be posted after programs have been assessed (for quizzes and assignments) and after solutions have been released (for labs), but should not be posted before. This is of course essential for quizzes and assignments; posting code before submissions have been assessed is reprehensible and punishable by University policy on plagiarism. For labs, which are not assessed, it is indeed preferable to let everyone give their best shot for a week, till solutions are released. Then sharing code, comparing solutions, discussing the pros and cons of different designs and implementations, is a very valuable exercise. "
"Lab 2 ,Q2","Hi professor, I have a question about the definition of 'perfect numbers'. As you input 100, and the result is 6 and 28. Does that mean there is only 2 perfect numbers range from 1 to 100. So how to explain 12 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6, I think that 12 also has the characteristics of perfect numbers. Is that included? Thanks","Hi, mathematically, perfect number is equal to the sum of its proper divisors. Proper divisors here means a divisor other than itself. So 6 and 28 is a perfect number because sum of proper divisors of 6 {1,2,3} is the number 6 itself. Hope this helps, thanks."
"Lab2, cycloidal_curves.pdf updated",,"The definition of period was incorrect in the original version, fixed in current version; thank you to Junnan Chen for having pointed it out."
lab2 perfect number,"I think '1' is also a perfect number because 1 is a only divisor for itself and 1=1,therefore, 1 could be a perfect number

Or 1 is special condition?","Hi Chenyang, we take only the proper divisors, meaning, excluding the number itself."
Course consultation,Hi can any one please tell me where exactly will be consultation conduction on tuesday from 6 30 pm to 8 30 pm.  I mean the location???,See course outline.
Problem with Quiz 1,"I was working on quiz 1 when I received an error and the code wouldn't execute anymore. I restarted by web browser and now I can't access quiz 1, it says ""There are no assignments yet. Check back later."".

I've tried restarting my browser, clearing history and cookies, logging out and back in, but I still can't access the quiz again to finish my attempt.

Is there something that I'm doing incorrectly to access the quiz?","Indeed, there is a problem,, no more message on this please, it might take some time to get back."
Quiz 1 disappeared,"The Quiz 1 disappeared on 22:30 PM,today, I notice that the due date is Thursday.

so I still code it...",It is back.
Case in Quiz 1,"In the special case (quiz 1, second exercise: N) in which all the elements on the right have been taken already, should I take the rightmost element in the list or start from the left?

Let's say L is: 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 4

After three steps N will be: 4, 4, 4

L will be: 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 4, with the underline meaning it is taken

The next number should be 2 (go to the end of the list and if they are all taken start from the beginning) or 1, which is the rightmost number available?

Thank you","Hi, If I understand correctly based on the test cases and also the description, when an index is taken, get back to the left-most and get the unused value. Please correct me if I am wrong, thanks."
Lab 1 Q1,"in Lab 1, Qu 1 why is there an f in the print output statement:

print(f'{Celsius ... }')

I get the same output when i remove the f and use:

print('{Celsius ...}')

is it redundant or are there cases where it is important to include the f before the quote mark?","It seems to be a new function in python3.6. It is used to format string literals. 

You can find the details in (PEP 498) https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html"
Lab2 Bayes,"It seems that I have difficulties understanding the question. As far as I know, Bayes is about conditional probability. I do not see anything related to that from the question.  I think just randomly rolled the dice and then record the result. Can anyone explain this for me. Thanks.",You need to compute the probability of a die being the chosen die given the value that is rolled.
where to submit the completed program,where to submit the completed program,If you go to the assessments tab and then click on quiz 1 you can enter your code where the comment asking for it is and then press submit which is next to run. I hope this is the right way to submit it because that's what I did.
String M requires 5 numbers,"I'm afraid I don't understand your reasoning for the answer you're giving for string M where only 4 numbers are generated.   The instruction requests 5 numbers: 1) middle, 2) first, 3) last, 4) second and 5) penultimate .  Therefore when a list of only 4 numbers is generated in L, one number must be repeated to get the correct result.   

The sample PDF indicates: 

""The generated list L is:

[3, 3, 0, 2]

Here is M:

[0, 3, 2, 3]""

But my reading of the question, the correct result for M is:

[0, 3, 2, 3, 0]

Am I reading the question wrong?  ","I think Dr.Martin was just making an example with 5 numbers, which are middle, first, last, second and penultimate. If your list only has 4 digits, then you get M as middle(pop), first(pop), last(pop) and the current first element, aka the penultimate element of the original list L."

Standard Library,"We are allowed to use any module from the standard library for quizzes, right?","Hi Rod, the answer is yes."
Question on quiz2,"If my input is 0 1 5, and I get a list of [3]. In this case, how would the output go? My output something like this:

The fractions no greater than 1 that can be built from L, from smallest to largest, are:

3

The fraction closest to 1/2 is 3

Is this correct? Or the output should be something else?","Hi Tiancong, no, recall that all fractions evaluate to 1 at most.

The generated list is:

[3]


The fractions no greater than 1 that can be built from L, from smallest to largest, are:

1

The fraction closest to 1/2 is 1"
For Quiz2,"If 1, 3, 9, 27 exists in generated List, how many ""1/3"" should show in fraction list?

1 or 3?","Hi Haotian, just 1."
"Quiz 2, error when testing","I think there might be an error in the expected answers for the quiz, as from test 5 and after there seems to be an extra 1 for the fractions no greater than 1.

Output for test 5:

The generated list is:

[12, 13, 1]


The fractions no greater than 1 that can be built from L, from smallest to largest, are:

-    1/13  1/12  12/13

+    1/13  1/12  12/13  1

The fraction closest to 1/2 is 1/12","Indeed, we take any pair of numbers a, b in the list, with a <= b, as we do not want to get a fraction greater than 1, and that gives us a/b, that we simplify, and output only once (what is unique is the fractions that we output). So indeed, we are sure to output 1 since our list contains at least one nonzero element (otherwise we exit), that we can divide by itself."
A Word Game characters,"For the assignment, ""A Word Game,"" if a character appears only once in the input, can it be used multiple times when forming a word?","Hi Rod, no, we consume occurrences of characters in the input."

"
Rubik’s rectangle,"My problem is the code consumes lots of time when I tested. The computing complexity increases exponentially with the steps, as a result, the code failed to pass the test when I tried to submit it online. My question is should I  optimize the algorithm to decrease the running time or it is just fine as the code output is correct.","Hi Jingming, every test will be run for 30 seconds, so your code should output a solution within that time, which should be much more than necessary. We will discuss an efficient approach to the problem."
Poker Dice,"In the pdf, it is mentioned that ""No die is kept by inputting nothing"". Does nothing include a string of whitespaces? Or should it show the error message?","Hi Rod, yes, ""nothing"" includes whitespace."
for Assignment question3,"When I submit my codes, it alarms that 'run_submissions.sh: line 40:   620 Done                    { sleep 0.2; echo ""eaeo rtsmnz"" | tee -a tmp_outputs.txt; }

-        622 Killed                  | python3 highest_scoring_words.py'

What's wrong with it?

","Hi Hangyu, that means that Ed killed your program as it did not produce the output in the allocated time (30 seconds), so you need to make your code more efficient."
Quiz 2 clarification question,"Is there any possibility that number 0 will be generated into list? In that case, x/0 may occur, then I assume a fraction of 0 should be printed?","0 should be included, as one of the test cases do have 0 as an answer."
Quiz 2 question,"Can someone please explain what the line below means?

- if ""fractions"" contains then 1/2, then the fact that 1/2 belongs to ""fractions"";

The part 'contains then 1/2' is confusing.","Yes, sorry, typo, should have read: if ""fractions"" contains 1/2, ."
generating list L,"1) With the three input arguments, is it possible to generated the singleton list [0]?

2) I thought 2, 2, 2 would be a valid input, but why does the program give up on these arguments?","If you examine the code, the program may generate a list of all 0s. However, it will also exit the program and print ""failed to generate one strictly positive number, giving up."".

It's because of the check below which is already in the scaffold.\"

What I'm trying to do is compare my program to the output provided in the sample output PDF using doctest.","That is probably because the quote you pasted is not the ASCII quote. You often need to edit parts of what you copy and paste from a pdf, quotes in particular."
Quiz 2 Question,"0 can not be a denominator, so what will happen if the genarated list is [0, 0, 0, 0, 0], or [0] ?","If this is the case, the program exits automatically.

List Comprehension vs Filter+Lambda combo,"In the Monday lecture, you showed two ways to filter, one is thru list comprehension, the other through filter + lambda. Both make sense, but I'm wondering which one would be more efficient to run from memory perspective? Which is more pythonic?","Hi Simon, if we want to answer this kind of question having time complexity in mind, then we need to run experiments and compare both constructs. The usual way to do it is to use functions from the timeitmodule. That is actually something I could show you in another Monday lecture... In terms of space complexity, both versions are essentially equivalent, being based on the iterator paradigm (something we will talk about)."

The second one is about the strictly positive n used in the assignment 1.5 as an input for the simulation, here should I also consider what if the n is not a positive integer such as blank space, negative number or string? If yes, then what kind of exit word should I type in this case since there is no such a example shown in the PDF you gave to us. Thank you for your answer and have a nice day!","Hi Xiaohui, I will not test against this.

More generally, often, even most of the time, it is perfectly fine to let Python generate the appropriate error. If we had to catch every possible error, then we would have to check that every function is called the way it is meant to be called, passing the right number of arguments, of the right type, it would result in a nightmare of a code, and it would be against Python's choice for flexibility (the so called ""duck typing"" principle)."
Lab5 Q2 permutation,"Sorry I was confused about this sentence on Lab5, Q2:

""It can be shown that the puzzle is solvable iff the permutation of the integers 1, . . . , 8, determined by reading those integers off the puzzle from top to bottom and from left to right, is even.""

Does that mean finding the positions of each rows and columns in all possible 2- or 3-permutations of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]?

Take:

1 2 3

4 5 6

7 8

For example,  position of (4, 5, 6) in the total 3-permutations of [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] is 147.

About Quiz 8,About quiz 8 i have question that should I write all my code in the function explore_depth_first or I can define some other functions by myself?,"No Jianyu, a location cannot be visited more than once. You can define other functions that would be called by explore_depth_first(), though there is not really a use for it.

Final exam,What should we practice for final exam? Are they the lab challenges excuding the ones before mid-term?,"Hi Shekhar, all labs from the beginning, so I can get a chance to target some of the easiest questions again."
Assignment 2,"I notice that for sudoku 4, it can be completely worked out by implementing preemptive set method while for sudoku 5 the question has not been completely accomplished yet. So we just follow the progress that can be mostly made but do not need to fully work it out? Thank you for your answer!

",A simple Google search should give you the answer.
ass2 --- preassess functions,"I wrote the preassess() function and it makes me confused

My function is to test three situations (row , column ,box) and if all passed it will return the ''There might be a solution.''  (it is worked in my computer)

However, in the 'ed' it shows me No Output. but if I change return to print , it will pass test.

So, how to explain this situation.","Hi Chenyang, preassess() is indeed supposed to print out the appropriate statement, not return a string. If preassess() returns a string s and you call preassess() from the Python prompt, then s will be displayed, but if you call preassess() from within a script, then the return value, s, is just lost."
Data in the class,"I face a problem in the class, I want to use some result from other function which means it must execute that functions at first, otherwise, it shows error
For example, after forced_tex_output(), I get a list to store number and name is ''self.result'', then I want to use this list in  marked_tex_output() but it shows me "" self.result is not define''. Unless, I run forced_tex_output() at first.

I just want to run marked_tex_output() directly without forced_tex_output() at first.
How could I execute current function without use that at first?","If I'm understanding you correctly it sounds like the calculation of 'self.result' is required by both forced_tex and marked_tex.

Why not make it a separate function that they both call when needed?"
Quiz 8 - Expected Outputs,"Could somebody confirm the expected output for the following inputs? 

Enter five integers:  0 10 9 7 11

Here is the grid that has been generated:

Quiz 8 - X and Y,"So, the spec mentions being given an X and Y coord, and the given variables are labeled thusly. However the solutions seem to work on a (column, row) system with which would actually make it (y,x)

So can someone confirm for me is (0,0) at the top left, or bottom left? and is (0,1) to the left or or below (0,0)?","(0,0) is top left
(0,1) is to the left

When you move vertically you have to change the variable of X and when you move Horizontally you have to change the Variable of Y axis. Because
The first number in (0,0) represents the location of the first list in grid then second number represents the location of the  item of list gird[0].

X points to your rows

Y points to your column

.....y

.......0 1 2 3 4 5

x0   2 3 5 6 8 9
x1   5 8 6 4 8 9


So, for us to move vertically from 2 in grid[0][0]
we need to change it to grid[1][0]
to move horizontally, grid[0][1]"
Quiz 8 Question," have a question, if we input 0 2 0 0 1

Queue simulation,,"Thanks to Hui Shao to have pointed out that for inter-arrival time, an exponential distribution, not a Poisson distribution, should be used. This is actually what I did in a previous version of this program, that I modified in different ways, and I stubbornly refused to think that this could be the problem, partly encouraged by what I had been reading, but the relationship between exponential and Poisson distribution is not what I thought it was... The archive for Lecture 9 now contains an amended version of this program."
Quiz 9 Question,,
Quiz 9 ,,"I have uploaded an amended version of quiz9 as the specs did not express properly what I had in mind, and the complication of the ill-formulated original formulation is not worth it, so I simplified it, and the expected outputs have changed accordingly.

lab_9 Q2,"I am confused about that for a given word, how could we efficiently find the list of words that match the word with a 'slot' being replaced by only one letter. Cuz my methods always run for a long time. Could you give me some hint to solve it? Thank you!","Hi Hangyu, the specs provide a hint already, so keep thinking and experimenting if you have time, and otherwise wait for the solution which will come out in a couple of days."
Quiz9 tree height,"I just noticed tree printing takes time, whenever tree height goes beyond 6 and its quite difficult to verify the output for our test cases (manually) because of too much scroll. Can you please confirm, the depth you going to use in your test cases?

For example, 0 11 11 print too many lines.","Hi Shoaib, you are right, and I will indeed limit test cases to inputs that produce reasonable outputs. (Still printing should take no time when he program is run from the command line; it is a different story when one uses Idle)."
Lab_10 Q2: Possible subtractions yielding a given sum,"In Q2: I did not understand the reason why ""all ways of inserting minus signs and parentheses in L"" disallows cases like this: 1 - 2 - (3 - 4 - 5). Did you imply that the number of parentheses must be maximal? 

I tried it without setting the number of parentheses to maximal (which is 2*len(L)-4 ), and yielded a result like this:

subtractions((1, 2, 3, 4, 5), 5)

1: 1 - 2 - (3 - 4 - 5)

2: (1 - 2) - (3 - 4 - 5)

3: 1 - 2 - ((3 - 4) - 5)

4: (1 - 2) - ((3 - 4) - 5)

and I found that lines 1, 2, 3 do not contain {2*len(L)-4} parentheses, yet still satisfy the evaluation requirement.","Hi Feng, indeed the intention is that associativity rules are not left implicit, but are always explicit, so only the outmost pair of parentheses is omitted."
Lab 2: Number of trailing 0s in a factorial,"Hi Eric,

I hope you're well.  Can you please help understand the bold italic statement below?  I'm struggling to understand the steps to:

Split the multiple of 10 into multiple of 2 * 5, and 

the fact that we can use power of five based on statement ""has at least as many multiples of 2 as multiples of 5"".  I assume this is using some mathematical concepts and/or techniques.  I would greatly appreciated point me in the right direction.

N rather N!, hence that does not suffer the limitations of the first two, and is very efficient. The number of trailing 0s in N! is equal to the number of times N! is a multiple of 10, so to the number of times N! is a multiple of 2 × 5. It is easy to verify that N! has at least as many multiples of 2 as multiples of 5. Hence the number of trailing 0s in N! 

Thank you in advance for your help.","We want to find out how many 0’s we have at the end of N!, so how many times 10 divides N!, so how many times 2*5 divides N!

In N!, ever second factor is a multiple of 2 (N! = 2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10*…)  whereas every 5th factor is a multiple of 5 (N! = 2*3*4*5*6*7*8*9*10*…), with the first multiple of 2 (2 itself) occurring before the first multiple of 5 (5 itself).

So whatever N has happens to be, we will see more factors of 2 than factors of 5.

So the number of times 2*5 divides N! is equal to the number of times 5 divides N!, as we can always associate a 2 with each 5 we find."

Fixed - Error Metafont Marked and Forced methods when generating Tex files,"I am having problems when I submit part 2 of the assignment
On my local computer everything is working and diff exits silently when I run diff. I even copyied all expected_sudoku*.tex to my pc and tested with it, as you can see in followed image.However when I try to submit, only marked and worked methods fails and there are some strange logs regarding to metafonts.
Here is the log for sudoku_3.txt() when call method sudoku.marked_tex_output()
In my computer all tests are passing for all sudoku_*.txt and generate correctly all *.tex files.
So, my guess is that I  there is some problem when creating tex files on Ed environment, as there diff exits silently when running on my local workstation.
The way I am creating tex files is creating a new tex file and print all the content in this file (header + lines + footer):
What should I do?",
Assignment2 forced output and marked output,"When I am working on Assignment 2, I find that marked output is based on forced output. That means forced_tex_output should run first, then marked_tex_output can get a correct output. However, I find that in Ed, they are tested separately. That means I have to put forced_tex_output in marked_tex_output so that marked_tex_output can generate a correct tex file. If not, the test on marked_tex_output will go wrong. Is it right to do so?","Hi Fengting, that is correct, this has been said in other posts already."

The Pythonic Way,"This may be an abstract question, but what recommendations do you have as to coding more pythonically, thinking more pythonically, and understanding more pythonic code? After looking at the lab solutions, I definitely would not immediately approach a solution the same way.
Is it simply based on greater experience coding in python?","Hi Isaac, it sure comes with experience. I recommend the reading of Fluent Python by Luciano Ramalho, and Python Cookbook, by Jones and Beazley. Everyone should come across constructs that revive memories of code previously written with the realisation that there is such a better way, sometimes associated with a slight feeling of embarrassment... Then try and find out where is that code that you realised could be improved thanks to what you read, and improve it indeed. I gave you lots of programs many of which you most likely did not have time or ""incentive"" to look at, as part of the lecture material and also as optional lab questions. I strived to cover a broad range of pythonic constructs and techniques. If you study this code that should help, and of course you can read plenty of good code from a variety of sources, but I think you can learn a lot from many of the sample programs which are part of the course."

But operation wise I felt there wasn't any difference in creating the two dictionaries and using them as a list. Kindly explain. Thank you.  ","Hi Amrut, if we can choose between lists and sets then it is preferable to go for sets as they are more efficient. I could have used defaultdict(list) for both; I could also have used defaultdict(set) for both, and the latter would be preferable to the former. I used defaultdict(list) rather than defaultdict(set) so as to work with the two loops
for i in range(len(contextual_slots[slot])):
                    for j in range(i + 1, len(contextual_slots[slot])):
rather than ranging twice over a set, and then having to check every time that both members of the set (words) are different to record that either can be followed by the other. Starting j with i+1 guarantees that both words are different."

Do not join the lab before you are invited to do so. Indeed, the inviligators will first log into the exam environment, before inviting you to get into the lab and leave your belongings (mobile phone included) against a wall, with the exception of your student card which you should have with you, pens, and possibly a dictionary as requested by some of you. You will then be able to log into your personal account using your own credentials (zid, zpass). You will have access to all applications available on the School servers but neither to the Internet nor email. Most of you will use Idle. Those of you who wish to use another IDE can explore what is available on the School lab machines, but note that you cannot have any personal configuration file, you will have a ""clean"" account without any personal file.

The exam questions will be displayed as a pdf, as well as a cheat sheet.

Idle will be open and a number of .py files will be available that you will just have to edit and save; they will be collected for marking, so the whole procedure is straightforward, you just have to edit, test and save. A simple right click will give you access to Idle and the pdf's in case you ""lose"" them.
