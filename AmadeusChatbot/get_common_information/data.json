The course addresses the skills and knowledge required in industry to brainstorm, design, implement, and evaluate an application through the user-centred design process. Because this is an iterative process, students will be required to build their interface at least three times, starting with a low-fidelity prototype and building to high-fidelity and more complete prototypes. By the end of the course, students should have a solid understanding of the importance of user-centred design and how it is applied in the industry to design, test and build a functioning application. \nThe course is built to reflect up-to-date industry practice and methods. You would have benefitted from also completing COMP2911, which introduces you to object-oriented techniques, UML and design patterns. Whilst you will be coding in this course to build an iteration of your application, this is not the focus of the course, which remains on design practices and testing of graphical user interfaces.\u00a0\n",

Since no polynomial time algorithm is known for any of these problems, the running time of the algorithms will have a super-polynomial dependence on the input size or some other parameter of the input.\nThe first part presents algorithmic techniques to solve NP-hard problems provably faster than brute-force in the worst case, such as branching algorithms, dynamic programming across subsets, inclusion-exclusion, local search, and measure &amp; conquer. We will also see lower bounds for algorithms and how to rule out certain running times assuming the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis.\nWhereas the first part presents \"default\" algorithms that one would use without knowing much about the instances one is about to solve, the second part acknowledges that the complexity of an instance does not only depend on its size n. A parameter k is associated with each instance and the parameterized complexity framework aims at designing fixed-parameter algorithms whose running times are f(k)*poly(n) for a computable function f. This gives efficient algorithms for small values of the parameter obtained via techniques such as branching, colour coding, iterative compression, and kernelization (preprocessing). We will also see problems that are not fixed-parameter tractable and not kernelizable to polynomial kernels subject to complexity-theoretic assumptions.\n",

This is done by comparing  some of the more successful models of concurrency found in the  literature. The focus will be on the rationale behind the design  decisions underlying those models, viewed from philosophical,  mathematical and computational perspectives. The course contains  important background knowledge for students aiming at a scientific  career in which the design of mathematical models of system behaviour is  a component.\nTopics chosen from: semantic models of  concurrent and distributed systems (e.g. process algebra, event  structures, Petri nets, Chu spaces), operational and denotational  semantics, semantic equivalences and implementation relations, linear  versus branching time, interleaving versus partial order semantics, true  concurrency, algorithms for equivalence checking and their complexity,  modal and temporal logic for concurrent systems.\n",

This course looks at ways in which business processes can be analysed, redesigned, and improved thus ensuring that they are meeting the needs of customers and the enterprise. A business process is a set of related activities that jointly realise a business goal in an organisational and technical environment. These processes take place in a single organisation but may need to interact with processes in other organisations. Business process management (BPM) is concerned with the concepts, methods, and techniques that support the design, improvement, management, configuration, enactment, and analysis of business processes that deliver lean and customer focused business processes. BPM includes process modelling that explicitly represents processes \u2013 once they are defined, processes can be analysed, improved, and enacted. Software in the form of business process management systems can be used to manage business process.\n",

Specifically, INFS3605 is the \u2018capstone\u2019 IS course that is centrally organised around practical, experiential, group software projects. Throughout the course, students will apply programming knowledge and teamwork skills learnt in previous courses in an applied and integrated fashion. The course begins with student groups brainstorming and developing their software project ideas and then gathering requirements. Following this, student groups engage in an iterative development process in designing and refining their software application. Specifically, students will use the agile scrum framework in developing their software project, working in two-week sprints/iterations. This hands-on project course takes a blended approach to learning, mixing online content provided through the school\u2019s e-learning platform (Moodle) with weekly flipped workshop sessions. Throughout the course, students will perform various roles (including scrum master and product owner) and ceremonies (including sprint planning, stand-up sessions, sprint reviews, sprint retrospectives and backlog refinement), as well as utilise a number of a tools (such as kanban boards, burndown charts and planning poker).\nOverall, this capstone project course requires students to apply, integrate and build upon existing knowledge and skills learnt in previous IS courses. In particular, the course requires students to perform as agile scrum teams and develop complex software applications in an iterative and incremental manner.\n",

The vehicle for the practical component is a service-oriented specification and design of a non-trivial information system which will be undertaken by teams.\nThe choice of business application will be negotiated by the student group with their consulting academic, who will provide ongoing supervision and guidance through regular meetings. The system development practical work will include requirements analysis, system design and proof-of-concept prototype implementation. To achieve the objectives of the course the concepts, principles and approaches are reinforced by workshops on related topics and information on the implementation platform that would enable a prototype implementation with minimal amount of coding.\nPlease note: INFS3611 last intake is s1 2018.

It covers topics of concern to individuals as well as business and government, including protection of intellectual property in a digital environment, electronic contracts, computer and information security, and cyber crime.\u00a0\u00a0\nThe interaction between traditional law and modern technology plays a central role in the course. In order to analyse the impact and application of traditional legal principles in a new technological environment, the principles must be translated into the language of the technologies involved. The translation must preserve the original meaning and policy rationale. It is the aim of the course to teach, encourage and nurture such thinking. Examples of problems we shall encounter and analyze in the course include the connection between enabling technologies of cyber crime and the contours of liability of cyber criminals and their enablers; how an understanding of the Internet informs whether notice of electronic contractual terms is properly provided by a hyperlink; and determining whether an implied term of fitness for purpose can be read into a contract to download software.\nA statement by Professor Lawrence Lessig captures the essence of the course: \u201c[w]hen dealing with cyberspace, judges are to be translators; different technologies are the different languages; and the aim is to find a reading of [legal principles] that preserves [their] meaning from one world\u2019s technology to another. This is fidelity as translation.\u201d[1] Lawyers who fail to understand the translation will likely pursue sub-optimal litigation strategies, face speculative recovery prospects, and may overlook effective and potentially powerful defences.\nMain Topics\n<ul><li>Introduction to the Internet and related technologies</li><li>Information technology patents</li><li>Translation</li><li>Electronic contracts</li><li>Computer and information security</li><li>Cyber crime: Law and enabling technologies</li></ul>\n",

To the extent possible, topics will be solicited and sponsored by the Australian Defence Force. Students are expected to take significant ownership of an original piece of work and reflect this to the wider community by presentations and a written thesis. A staff member is nominated as a supervisor to provide guidance and general supervision. Project management techniques will be adopted and assessed in the implementation of the project. A series of briefings will be used to expose the students to basic research strategies and techniques. Evidence of sufficient progress may be required from time to time.\n",

We will also see lower bounds for algorithms and how to rule out certain running times assuming the (Strong) Exponential Time Hypothesis.\nWhereas the first part presents \"default\" algorithms that one would use without knowing much about the instances one is about to solve, the second part acknowledges that the complexity of an instance does not only depend on its size n. A parameter k is associated with each instance and the parameterized complexity framework aims at designing fixed-parameter algorithms whose running times are f(k)*poly(n) for a computable function f. This gives efficient algorithms for small values of the parameter obtained via techniques such as branching, colour coding, iterative compression, and kernelization (preprocessing). We will also see problems that are not fixed-parameter tractable and not kernelizable to polynomial kernels subject to complexity-theoretic assumptions.\n",

A business process is a set of activities that jointly realise a business goal in an organisational and technical environment. These processes take place in a single organisation but may need to interact with processes in other organizations. Business process management (BPM) is concerned with the concepts, methods, and techniques that support the design, administration, configuration, enactment, and analysis of business processes. BPM is concerned with the explicit representation of processes \u2013 once they are defined, processes can be analysed, improved, and enacted. Software in the form of business process management systems can be used to coordinate business process activities.\nBy taking this course you will be able to understand business process from a general management perspective, and learn tools, analytical frameworks and general principles for managing business processes. The course will incorporate a laboratory component using BPM software.\n",

In order to analyse theimpact and application of traditional legal principles in a new technological environment, the principles must be translatedinto the language of the technologies involved. The translation must preserve the original meaning and policy rationale. Itis the aim of the course to teach, encourage and nurture such thinking. Examples of problems we shall encounter andanalyze in the course include the connection between enabling technologies of cyber crime and the contours of liability ofcyber criminals and their enablers; how an understanding of the Internet informs whether notice of electronic contractualterms is properly provided by a hyperlink; and determining whether an implied term of fitness for purpose can be read intoa contract to download software.\nA statement by Professor Lawrence Lessig captures the essence of the course: \u201c[w]hen dealing with cyberspace, judgesare to be translators; different technologies are the different languages; and the aim is to find a reading of [legal principles]that preserves [their] meaning from one world\u2019s technology to another. This is fidelity as translation.\u201d[1] Lawyers who failto understand the translation will likely pursue sub-optimal litigation strategies, face speculative recovery prospects, andmay overlook effective and potentially powerful defences.\nMain Topics\n<ul><li>Introduction to the Internet and related technologies</li><li>Information technology patents</li><li>Translation</li><li>Electronic contracts</li><li>Computer and information security</li><li>Cyber crime: Law and enabling technologies</li></ul>\n",

The integrity of such critical digital assets then depends on the reliability and security of the software that enables and controls those assets.\u00a0 According to the latest reports, software application vulnerabilities are ranked the No.1 threat to information security professionals and will continue to be among the top cyber security concerns.\nWhile attackers and researchers continue to expose new application vulnerabilities, the many\u00a0common application flaws are very often previous, rediscovered threats. In many cases software applications operate as part of a larger systems thus face a number of different security risks. For example, security issues associated with implementing COTS software within existing systems. Most importantly, developing web applications in this current environment requires an understanding of:\n<ul><li>all security issues associated with software components and their interfaces within the larger system; and</li><li>applicability of a holistic approach to build security in starting from a user requirements, software design and implementation to testing and deployment.</li></ul>\nThis Masterscourse is designed to provide students with a deep understanding, and the skills to implement, manage and incorporate security practices throughout the whole Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), from identifying customer needs, writing secure requirements, designing, implementing, testing and deployment.\u00a0\u00a0\nThis course meets an essential requirement for software developers to stay current on the latest advances in software development and the new security threats they create. \u00a0This course is theoretical and covers not only the content of the ISC2 CSSLP\u00ae certification, but also provides a holistic view on a role of software applications within complex systems.

By concluding this subject, students would learn the use of simulation in the six domains: physical, information, cyber, cognitive, behavioural and social. In conjunction with the five military domains of land, sea, air, cyber and space, students will understand the use of simulation in defence, health, education, training, prediction, decision support, as thinking tools, for red teaming and for policy design.\nMore advanced discussions on experimentation using live, constructive and virtual simulations would expose students to design strategies, human factors, usability, and practical challenges in adopting simulation for decision making.
